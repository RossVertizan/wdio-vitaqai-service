Have this to the point where I can now run Vitaq jobs through the sauce service and have demonstrated running the Vitaq set_enabled command.

Now need to build out:
    1. The full set of commands on Vitaq
    2. The remaining commands in the Vitaq client

1. Vitaq commands
    Copied files into vitaq_methods that list all of the vitaq classes and methods in different YAML files.
   See if we can find a way to develop a YAML file to capture the arguments and the return values - use set_enabled as an example
